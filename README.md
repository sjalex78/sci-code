## Peculiarity For Development
### Tailwind Build
tailwind was not configuring found that I needed to run the following command to have it render correctly for the html. Still not sure if this will have to happen everytime?

```command
rails tailwindcss:build
```

Running rspec
```command
bundle exec rspec spec\filename
````

Running with tailwind real time update to server
```command
bin/dev ```
